* Anticipatory Set
    * Why is consensus important in Bitcoin?
    * Discuss the phrase ‘Rules without Rulers’	
* Objective and purpose in participant’s words
    * To understand how consensus is achieved in a group.
1. How do independent parties (who can not trust each other) come to an agreement or consensus without having to rely on a trusted third party?

1. GIVE CONTEXT
    1. Explain the battlefield laid out on the table. Each participant is a General leading their soldiers. Their mission is to lead a successful attack on the citadel in the centre of the table. To successfully conquer the citadel, the generals must decide as a group whether to attack or retreat; some may prefer to attack, while others prefer to retreat. The important thing is that all generals agree on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become a rout, and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.
2. DECENTRALISED (BARTER MARKETS)
    2. Hand out ATTACK and RETREAT cards to each participant
    3. For example, in a game with 5 participants, hand out 5 ATTACK and 5 RETREAT to each
    4. Countdown 3-2-1 - then participants reveal their orders to their ‘troops’. The attack or retreat should probably be a failure.
    5. Explain how this represents war with tribes or clans (barter and trade).
3. CENTRALISED (BANKING)
    6. Acting as a Commander-in-Chief, the workshop leader, hands out ATTACK or RETREAT orders.
    7. Countdown 3-2-1 - then participants reveal their orders to their ‘troops’. The attack or retreat should be a total success.
    8. Distribute the Traitor and Loyalist cards. Explain that the traitors must work to ensure the attack is a failure. ie. doing the opposite of the group.
    9. Repeat the steps above but this time, explain that the traitor generals should aim to sabotage the mission by going against the order of the Commander-in-Chief.
    10. Discuss how centralised systems achieve consensus through a central authority. Explain the weaknesses and issues of this type of system (trust, cancelled, hacked, compromised, exploited)
4. DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM (BITCOIN) - Ledge
    11. Explain that the Commander-in-Chief has been poisoned and that the generals must coordinate an attack without the assistance of Battlefield Command. A **battle plan** is handed to each unit, giving them a pattern to follow for the next few days in the conquest.
    12. Hand out the battle plan and show participants how it works using the **Example Battleplan.**
    13. The generals use the battle plan to see the past history of the other generals. They can identify the traitors and calculate the next strategy (ATTACK or RETREAT).
    14. Countdown 3-2-1 - then participants reveal their orders to their ‘troops’. The attack or retreat should be a success.
