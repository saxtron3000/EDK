** About the Materials**

The materials listed for each activity are suggested, tried, and tested — but by no means perfect. Every classroom, meetup, and community is different, and so is what’s available.

Use what you have. Improvise. Adapt.
What matters most isn’t having the perfect setup, but creating an authentic learning experience.
In Bitcoin education, as in life — what’s perfect is what’s available.

Each Activity Plan details which materials are required for that activity.
