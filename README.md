## üåç Overview

The **Educational Development Kit (EDK)** is a collection of **lesson plans**, **activities**, and **physical materials** designed to make Bitcoin education **interactive, engaging, and low-tech**.  
It is built on the belief that *learning Bitcoin should be human, tangible, and enjoyable*.

The EDK transforms foundational Bitcoin concepts into collaborative classroom or meetup experiences ‚Äî encouraging participants to *discover* principles like scarcity, value, trade, money, and self-custody through play and participation.

üß≠ Background

This Educational Development Kit (EDK) was developed in collaboration with Learning Bitcoin through a series of hands-on workshops held in Victoria (2024) and Vancouver (2025).

These events brought together educators, builders, and community members to prototype, test, and refine interactive learning experiences about Bitcoin. Each activity in this kit has been shaped by real participants ‚Äî their curiosity, feedback, and creativity.

A huge thanks to Learning Bitcoin for the opportunity to design and experiment with these ideas, and for supporting the vision of making Bitcoin education open, practical, and enjoyable for everyone.

## üéØ Mission

Bitcoin can be complex ‚Äî but teaching it doesn‚Äôt have to be.

- Provide **ready-to-use materials** and **lesson plans** that make teaching Bitcoin simple and fun.  
- Foster **interactive, discussion-based learning** instead of lectures and slides.  
- Create a **global open-source repository** of educational tools for Bitcoin adoption.  

This is an **open-source**, **low-tech**, and **accessible** approach ‚Äî perfect for classrooms, meetups, or informal community events anywhere in the world.

## Educational Philosophy

The **Learning Bitcoin EDK** is based on these key principles:

- **Learning by Doing:** Concepts are better understood when experienced.  
- **Open-Source Collaboration:** Anyone can teach, adapt, or remix these materials.  
- **Cultural Accessibility:** Activities are language-neutral, low-tech, and inclusive.  
- **Simplicity First:** We teach *why* before *how*.  
- **Play and Curiosity:** The most effective learning comes from exploration, not memorization.
