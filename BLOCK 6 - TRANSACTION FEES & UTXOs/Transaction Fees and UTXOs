1. ASSIGN ROLES - The workshop leader is the Postal worker (Use a Name Tag) at the counter… Explain that a Bitcoin Miner is like a Postal worker.
2. DECK OF CARDS - Demonstrate that Bitcoin fees are a bidding war. 
    1. Deal out the pack of cards to the participants - about 7 cards each.
    2. Place the paper with ‘BLOCK #1’ on the table and Explain that the miner can only choose <span style="text-decoration:underline;">three** transactions per block</span>.
    3. Allow the participants to ‘bid’ using the cards to get their transactions ‘accepted’ during each block.
    4. Each player places a card face-up on the table.
    5. You then pick the three highest cards and place them on the Block #1 paper - these three cards (transactions) have been ‘mined’.
    6. Return the cards that were not mined to the participants.
    7. Repeat the process for blocks 2, 3, 4, until participants understand the concept.

     

3. MAILING
    8. Explain to participants that they are at the post office. They have items to ship and deadlines to respect.
    9. Ask participants to arrange the objects in order of which they think will be the most expensive to the least expensive to ship.
    10. Discuss the reasons and criteria for sending parcels (size, weight, speed)
4. TRANSACTING
    11. Explain how transacting with Bitcoin is similar to sending a parcel. Ask which of the three criteria are important (~~size~~, weight, speed).
    12. Explain how UTXOs function. 
    13. Ask the participants to estimate the fees of sending the amounts of ‘bitcoin’ money on the table.
        1. For example, 
            1. 0.1 			LOWEST
            2. 0.01, 0.01 		LOW
            3. 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 		HIGH
            4. 0.02, 3, 0.2, 0.002	HIGHEST
5. CONSOLIDATING
    14. Explain that when the network is busy, fees are high. When the network is quiet, fees are low.
    15. Using the funds on the table, demonstrate how a UTXO consolidation would work.
